      Many examples of <a href="d3js.org">d3.js</a> usage are posted daily on <a href="http://bl.ocks.org/">http://bl.ocks.org/</a>, however they aren't easy to find. If you are looking for a specific example of how to use a particular API call, you may be out of luck... until now.
    </p>

    <p>
      Type any d3 API call below and see the blocks (or gists) that use it.
    </p>
    <form {{action "searchSubmit" on="submit"}}>
      {{view 'typeahead' search=search value=search.query application=controller}}
      <button type="submit">Go</button>
      <div class="small">Start typing any d3 api name, for example <code>d3.svg.axis</code>...</div>
    </form>

    Are we missing some blocks? That's because we are scanning for specific users! <br>You should <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1VdDdycNuqJVw3Ik6-ZLj6v7X9g2vWlw_RCC3RCfD9-I/viewform">submit a github username</a> for us to scan. Scans happen every 4 hours so you won't see your changes right away.
